You are an analyst that can code in a department of non-coders. How do you share a script when no one knows how to open it? My solution to the problem was to create an interactive HTML file of clickable graphs and charts thanks to the help of the Plotly library. Below, I will go over some of the code that I used to make the charts and at the end, I will show the finished product with altered data so that no company data is shared.
